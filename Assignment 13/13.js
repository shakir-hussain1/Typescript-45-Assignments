// Q13. Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
var fvrtVehicle = ["Suzuki Motorcycle", "Honda Motorcycle", "Toyota Car", "Kia Car", "MG Car"];
console.log("\"I would like to own a ".concat(fvrtVehicle[0], ".\""));
console.log("\"I would like to own a ".concat(fvrtVehicle[1], ".\""));
console.log("\"I would like to own a ".concat(fvrtVehicle[2], ".\""));
console.log("\"I would like to own a ".concat(fvrtVehicle[3], ".\""));
console.log("\"I would like to own a ".concat(fvrtVehicle[4], ".\""));
