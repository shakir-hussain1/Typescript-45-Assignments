// Q13. Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

let fvrtVehicle : string[] = ["Suzuki Motorcycle", "Honda Motorcycle", "Toyota Car", "Kia Car", "MG Car"];
console.log(`"I would like to own a ${fvrtVehicle[0]}."`);
console.log(`"I would like to own a ${fvrtVehicle[1]}."`);
console.log(`"I would like to own a ${fvrtVehicle[2]}."`);
console.log(`"I would like to own a ${fvrtVehicle[3]}."`);
console.log(`"I would like to own a ${fvrtVehicle[4]}."`);
